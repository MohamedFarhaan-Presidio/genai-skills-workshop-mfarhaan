            "*   **E-Challan:** This is becoming very common. Your violation is captured by a camera (e.g., for speeding or jumping a red light), and a challan is generated electronically. You will usually receive an SMS on the mobile number linked to your vehicle's registration.\n",

            "*   **Harassment:** If you feel you are being harassed or the officer is demanding a bribe, you can report it to senior police officials or the anti-corruption bureau.\n",
            "*   **Rules for Women:** A female driver cannot be stopped or asked to come to the police station between 6 PM and 6 AM. In case of a violation by a woman during these hours, the police must engage a woman officer.\n",
